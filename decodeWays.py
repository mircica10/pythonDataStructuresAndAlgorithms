"""
 A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping way:
'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26

Beyond that, now the encoded string can also contain the character '*', which can be treated as one of the numbers from 1 to 9.
Given the encoded message containing digits and the character '*', return the total number of ways to decode it.
Also, since the answer may be very large, you should return the output mod 10 power 9 + 7.
